### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Suakow. I experienced network programmability (especially on ISP's Internet backbone network, familiar with Juniper and Cisco programmability APIs) and automation for 3 years and experienced in software developement (webs, mobile apps and backend services) for 5 years. Currently, I am interested in machine learning and AI !
